An AI question answering bot for kids

My kids love talking to Alexa and asking it questions, but it's often not too smart, so this is an attempt to do
something better with modern AI.

And like any good side project, it's an excuse to play around with tech like WebRTC, three.js, and recent neural models
for speech generation.
